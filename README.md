My Cloud9 IDE
========================
This is a Chrome app which you can use to connect to any local or remote Cloud9 server. It will also allow you to connect to any c9.io dashboard or project directly as well.

If you are using this to connect to c9.io rather than an installed version of Cloud9 on a local or remote box, you will need to be able to log in with a username and password on c9.io. If you originally signed up with a github or bitbucket login just hit the forgot password using your email and you will get a password to use with your email. This will not efect your github or bitbucket accounts at all.

When you start the app up enter any information needed to reach a Cloud9 installation. The minimum required data is the hostname to the Cloud9 server. Everything else will default to the placeholder values you see in the input fields.

Each server you connect to will be stored on the left hand side of the My Cloud9 dash for convenient access at a later date from any device you are logged in on. These servers will automatically sync across your logged in chrome devices.

Also, if you are having trouble getting your own Cloud9 server set up please see the Gist I made after having issues myself.
